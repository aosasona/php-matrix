# php-matrix
Do you need to randomly assign new inputs to existing entries (like automatically and randomly assigning referrals in a referral scheme) ? This is meant for just that! Simply download/clone this repo and make very few edits for your usage or none at all!

Variables you should edit:

$max -> This specifies the maximum number of tables you want to be generated by the "set_matrix.php" script. The value for this variable should be the same in the "matrix.php" & "set_matrix.php" scripts.

$username -> By default, this is set to "user" data sent from a form using the POST method i.e. $_POST["USER"]

Take a look at the scripts and use comments I added to figure out what each part does.

If you need any help using this sciript or any of my other scripts, reach out to me @techacuemenyt
